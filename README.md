## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "dotnet: command not found"

**Problem:** .NET SDK is not installed or not in PATH

**Solution:**
- **Windows:** 
  - Download from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
  - Install the .exe file
  - Restart Command Prompt
  - Try: `dotnet --version`

- **Mac:**
  - `brew install --cask dotnet-sdk`
  - Or download from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

---

### Issue: "API Key is missing in appsettings.json"

**Problem:** You didn't add your API key

**Solution:**
1. Open `appsettings.json`
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key
3. Save the file
4. Stop the app (Ctrl+C) and run again: `dotnet run`

---

### Issue: "BadRequest" or "Error fetching news"

**Problem:** API key is invalid or not activated

**Solution:**
1. Check your email for NewsAPI confirmation
2. Log in to https://newsapi.org and verify your key is active
3. Make sure there are no spaces in the API key in appsettings.json
4. Try a different endpoint - the code uses the "everything" endpoint which works on free tier

**Test your API key manually:**
Open browser and go to:
```
https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=business&language=en&apiKey=YOUR_KEY
```
Replace `YOUR_KEY` with your actual key. You should see JSON data.

### Issue: Port already in use

dotnet run --urls="http://localhost:3000"
```
Then open: `http://localhost:3000/News`

### Issue: Build errors or warnings
